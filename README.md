# Simple Chat Group app with JMS and IBM MQ Topics


This App is an example of Publish / Subscribe to a Topic on Queue Manager.

There are three files: 
* ContextBuilder: for create context.
* PublishMessage: for  messages to the topic.
* Subscribe: for subscribe to the topic.

**_NOTE:_**  PublishMessage and Subscribe work on different threads .
